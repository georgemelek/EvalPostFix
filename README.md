# EvalPostFix
Using the Stack data structure, I took a postfix expression and evaluated it using functions such as peek(), peek2(), push(), pop(), etc. The reason this is useful is because the computer prefers postfixe expressions due to their lack of parentheses, and thus, easier readability. Any C++ compiler should easily be able to read the program, which is located under "code."
